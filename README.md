# lab-examples


For the second term of the freshman year at Piri Reis Uni, 
Lecture : Computer Programming 2 ( C/C++ )


These are little examples that our lab assistant teacher wanted to us done for the summary of the last week, in every lab lecture. 


And also, I added little examples that I inspired by my coding quizzes and tests.


Now, time for technical part; I usually coded these examples in Xcode which is an app that developed by apple, for some users I hope these examples would be helpful because somethings can be different in Xcode.

And also, most of these examples can be converted on C++.
