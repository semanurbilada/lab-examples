## Computer Programming 2
# C - C++

For the second term of the freshman year at Piri Reis Uni, lab examples.

These are little examples that our lab assistant teacher wanted to us done for the summary of the last week, in every lab lecture. 


And also, I added little examples that I inspired by my coding quizzes and tests.


Now, time for technical part; I usually coded these examples in Xcode which is an app that developed by Apple, for some users I hope these examples would be helpful because somethings can be different in Xcode.

And also, most of these examples can be converted on C++.
